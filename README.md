Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Program. Project 2.

This project required me to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. A starter code was provided and used.

Task 1: Dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections of the page.

Task 2: Add functionality to distinguish the section in view.

Task 3: Add the functionality to scroll to sections by clicking on a navigation item.
